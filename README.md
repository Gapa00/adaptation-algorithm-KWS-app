This is a bachelor thesis which aims to achieve energy-efficient mobile deep learning by implementing real-time selection of compressed neural networks for keyword spotting on Android devices.
It involves developing a baseline Android app for keyword detection using three compressed lightweight neural networks trained on a Google Speech Commands dataset. Compressed networks are implemented using differing architectures and compression techniques such as post-training quantization. A control algorithm dynamically selects the optimal model based on factors like device battery level and previous inference confidence. The research quantifies energy savings and analyzes the impact of real-time model complexity control on keyword spotting accuracy, serving as a stepping stone toward real-time adaptive model compression on Android devices.
